# Talking Icons Files
Repo where [Talking Icons](https://github.com/NicknameGG/talking-icons) gets the phrases and death messages

## death.txt
Phrases done after the Icon is clicked

## phrases.txt
Phrases while the icon is still alive

## Format
The only limit for the characters is on which GD can render which are just the basic ones.
It also can't render "\n" for obvious reasons.

Other than that, phrases can be anything!
