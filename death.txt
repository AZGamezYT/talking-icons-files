wow, mean.
you're so mean
I knew that you hated me, but I subestimated how much.
you're a bad person
:(
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed
Everytime you kill me, I die a little inside
Are you happy now?
Go ahead, kill me again. I have nothing left to live for.
I'm not even mad, I'm impressed.
Look at what you've done.
Very funny.
Stop it.
